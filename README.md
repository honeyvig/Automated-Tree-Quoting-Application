# Automated-Tree-Quoting-Application
Our project aims to streamline quoting by allowing users to upload photos or videos of trees. Our model will analyze these images to assess factors like tree size, branch diameter, condition, and nearby objects such as wires, windows, cars, and fences, enabling instant, accurate quotes without manual input. We’re focused on building a robust CVT solution that can handle various tree types and conditions based solely on user images.
-----------------------
To develop a solution for the problem described — streamlining the process of tree assessment and quoting based on images or videos — we need to implement a Computer Vision (CV) model that can analyze tree-related factors such as tree size, branch diameter, condition, and surrounding objects (like wires, windows, cars, fences). We'll leverage deep learning techniques and pre-trained models to perform image classification, object detection, and regression tasks.
Key Steps for Building the CV Model:

    Data Collection & Preprocessing: You'll need a dataset of images or videos of trees with annotations for tree size, branch diameter, and nearby objects.
    Model Architecture: Use deep learning models like YOLO (You Only Look Once) for object detection (for identifying objects like branches, wires, etc.), Mask R-CNN for segmentation tasks (to segment tree components), or Faster R-CNN.
    Feature Extraction & Regression: Once objects are detected, we can estimate tree size, branch diameter, etc., either through simple geometric calculations or by training a regression model based on image features.
    Integration with User Input: The application needs to accept user-uploaded images or videos, process them, and return the results as an automated quote.

High-Level Plan:

    Model for Object Detection and Segmentation: Detect the tree and surrounding objects.
    Post-processing: Analyze and extract specific metrics like tree size and branch diameter.
    Integration: Build a system to provide quotes based on the extracted metrics.

Step-by-Step Python Code for Tree Quoting Model

Below is an outline of the Python code that can help set up such a model using OpenCV, TensorFlow, and Keras for deep learning.
Step 1: Install Required Libraries

Make sure you have the following libraries installed:

pip install tensorflow opencv-python numpy matplotlib

Step 2: Preprocess the Image and Detect Objects

We will use a pre-trained model like YOLOv5 (object detection) or Mask R-CNN to identify different objects (tree components and nearby obstacles like wires, cars, etc.).

Here is an example of loading a YOLOv5 model for detecting objects in tree images:

import cv2
import torch
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load YOLOv5 model from PyTorch Hub (pre-trained)
model = torch.hub.load('ultralytics/yolov5', 'yolov5s')  # 'yolov5s' is the smallest version

def process_image(image_path):
    # Read and preprocess image
    image = cv2.imread(image_path)
    image_rgb = cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB)

    # Perform object detection
    results = model(image_rgb)
    return results, image_rgb

def display_results(results, image_rgb):
    # Display image with bounding boxes
    results.show()
    plt.imshow(image_rgb)
    plt.show()

# Example usage
image_path = 'tree_image.jpg'
results, image_rgb = process_image(image_path)
display_results(results, image_rgb)

In this step:

    YOLOv5 is used to detect various objects in the image, including trees and potential obstacles (e.g., cars, fences, wires).
    The results.show() method will display bounding boxes around detected objects.

Step 3: Extract Tree-Specific Metrics

Once we detect trees and nearby objects, we can extract metrics such as the size of the tree (bounding box area) and branch diameter (using segmentation or regression). For simplicity, let’s assume that the bounding box of the tree represents its size.

We can also use object detection results to estimate tree size and branch diameter based on the image's resolution.

def extract_metrics(results):
    # Get bounding boxes for detected objects
    tree_detected = False
    tree_size = 0
    branch_diameter = 0
    
    for label, confidence, bbox in zip(results.xywh[0][:, -1], results.xywh[0][:, 4], results.xywh[0][:, :-1]):
        if label == 0:  # Assuming '0' is the label for trees in the model
            tree_detected = True
            x1, y1, x2, y2 = bbox
            width = x2 - x1
            height = y2 - y1
            tree_size = width * height  # Approximate size based on bounding box area
            
            # Assuming some method to estimate branch diameter based on bounding box size or predefined models
            branch_diameter = width * 0.1  # Placeholder for actual model to estimate branch diameter
            
    return tree_detected, tree_size, branch_diameter

# Example usage
tree_detected, tree_size, branch_diameter = extract_metrics(results)
if tree_detected:
    print(f"Tree Size (area): {tree_size} pixels")
    print(f"Estimated Branch Diameter: {branch_diameter} units")
else:
    print("No tree detected.")

Here:

    We check the label returned by YOLO for detecting trees (usually labeled as 0 for trees).
    We calculate the tree size based on the bounding box area (width * height).
    For branch diameter, you can develop a more sophisticated approach based on image segmentation or other AI models.

Step 4: Determine the Quote Based on Extracted Metrics

Now that we have the size of the tree and the estimated branch diameter, we can build a simple pricing model to generate an automated quote. Here's an example that uses a basic formula:

def generate_quote(tree_size, branch_diameter):
    # Simple formula to generate quotes based on tree size and branch diameter
    base_rate = 100  # Base rate for the quote
    
    # Pricing based on tree size (larger trees cost more)
    size_factor = tree_size * 0.05  # A factor to scale the price based on size

    # Pricing based on branch diameter (larger branches might require more work)
    branch_factor = branch_diameter * 20  # A factor for branch diameter

    total_quote = base_rate + size_factor + branch_factor
    return total_quote

# Example usage
quote = generate_quote(tree_size, branch_diameter)
print(f"Estimated Quote: ${quote:.2f}")

In this simple example:

    The base rate is $100.
    The price increases based on the tree size and branch diameter.
    The formula for calculating the quote can be adjusted based on your pricing structure.

Step 5: Putting It All Together

Finally, here’s a function to integrate all of the above steps, from image upload to quote generation:

def generate_tree_quote(image_path):
    # Step 1: Process Image and Detect Objects
    results, image_rgb = process_image(image_path)

    # Step 2: Extract Metrics (Tree Size and Branch Diameter)
    tree_detected, tree_size, branch_diameter = extract_metrics(results)

    if tree_detected:
        # Step 3: Generate Quote
        quote = generate_quote(tree_size, branch_diameter)
        return f"Estimated Quote: ${quote:.2f}"
    else:
        return "No tree detected in the image."

# Example usage
image_path = 'tree_image.jpg'
quote = generate_tree_quote(image_path)
print(quote)

Next Steps and Improvements

    Refine Detection Models: The current implementation uses YOLOv5 for object detection, but you may want to fine-tune the model with more specific tree data to increase accuracy.
    Segmentation for Branch Diameter: Instead of approximating the branch diameter, use segmentation models like Mask R-CNN for more precise feature extraction.
    Training Custom Models: If you don't have a sufficient dataset, you may need to label a dataset of tree images and use it to train a custom model specifically for tree detection and measurement.
    Real-Time Video Processing: If you plan to process video instead of static images, you will need to adapt the code to handle video streams frame by frame.
    User Interface: For deployment, consider building a web or mobile interface where users can upload images/videos and receive quotes.

Conclusion:

This Python-based framework for tree detection and quoting leverages object detection models to analyze tree-related metrics and generate accurate quotes. By integrating YOLOv5 for object detection and combining it with custom feature extraction and pricing models, you can create a robust solution for automating tree assessments.
